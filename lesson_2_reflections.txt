What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need 
to do it?

It creates a git repository in the specified directory. So we 
can add commit in to Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging are is where you want to put files that you want 
to commit while the directory is just a directory you can 
things that you might not want to commit and the repository is 
where the commits get put to when you run git commit.Like a 
said you might put something in the working directory that you 
might otherwise not want to commit and the whole logical 
change thing is already explain in the whole lesson.
